        <h2>Who is Blaise Pascal?</h2>
      <p>Born on June 19th, 1623, in France Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician, physicist, writer, and philosopher who was highly influential in laying the foundation to the theory of probabilities and developing the first calculating machine known as the pascaline. At the young age of 16 he wrote his first treatise known as the “Essay on Conics” in which Pascal states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle or conic, the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on the Pascal line. This work was so well written that in fact the french philosopher Rene Descartes scoffed in belief that a child had written such a intricate treatise. Perhaps his most important contribution was the invention of the Pascaline in due part to assist his father in his endless calculations as a tax collector in france. Arguably his most prominent impact to mathematics was his work on the probability theory that began to culminate on the issue of gambling problems. Furthermore, Pascal also created the Pascals triangle which demonstrates the use of binomial coefficients. In addition to his contributions to mathematics Pascal also advanced the world of physics through his study into fluid mechanics, pressure, and the vacuum. Some notible inventions by the french mathmetician include the syringe and the hydraulic press which we still utilize to this day. </p>
